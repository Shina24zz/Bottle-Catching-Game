The game involves controlling a bin using the mouse to catch falling objects, namely bottles and seeds, as they descend from the top of the screen. The player gains points for catching bottles and additional points and lives for catching seeds. The game gets progressively faster every 10 points.


Bin: Represented by an image, controlled by the mouse cursor, and positioned near the bottom of the screen.
Bottles: Falling objects represented by an image. The player scores points by catching them with the bin.
Seeds: Another type of falling object. Catching seeds not only scores points but also increases the player's lives.
Scoring and Lives:
Score: Tracks the player's score, incremented when bottles are caught and when seeds are caught.
Lives: Represents the number of lives the player has. The game deducts lives when bottles reach the bottom. Catching seeds adds lives.
